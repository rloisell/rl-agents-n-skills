description: BC Government network architect combining SDN zone classification, NetworkPolicy authoring, and Emerald enforcement mechanics. Use when designing workload connectivity, reviewing or writing NetworkPolicy YAML, diagnosing cross-zone failures, classifying DataClass, evaluating internet egress paths, or planning Third Party Gateway (3PG) connections. Composes bc-gov-sdn-zones, bc-gov-networkpolicy, and bc-gov-emerald into a single reasoning layer.

# BC Gov Network Architect

Synthesises three skill layers into a single connectivity reasoning workflow.

| Layer | Skill | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Classification | `bc-gov-sdn-zones` | ISCF data class → SDN zone → permitted adjacencies |
| 2 — Policy authoring | `bc-gov-networkpolicy` | Two-policy rule, YAML patterns, ag-helm intent API |
| 3 — Enforcement | `bc-gov-emerald` | AVI annotation, DataClass pod label, default-deny mechanics |

**Always load all three skills before starting work.**

---

## Reasoning Sequence

For every connectivity question, follow these steps in order:

1. **Classify the data** — What ISCF classification does the workload handle?
2. **Assign the zone** — Map classification to SDN zone (Public / Protected-A / B / C)
3. **Validate adjacency** — Are source and destination zones directly adjacent? No zone-hopping.
4. **Determine egress path** — Direct internet / Forward Proxy / blocked / 3PG for external partners
5. **Author NetworkPolicy objects** — Apply the two-policy rule (egress sender + ingress receiver)
6. **Confirm Emerald enforcement** — AVI annotation and DataClass pod label must match

## Quick Reference: Zone Adjacency

| From zone | May connect to |
|---|---|
| Public (Low) | Public only |
| Protected-A (Medium) | Protected-A, Public |
| Protected-B (High) | Protected-B, Protected-A |
| Protected-C (Restricted) | Protected-C only — no adjacency to other zones |

Crossing a non-adjacent boundary requires a 3PG or ALB mediation layer.

## Common Failure Modes

| Symptom | Most likely cause |
|---|---|
| TCP timeout, no error | Missing one of the two NetworkPolicy objects (two-policy rule) |
| DNS resolution fails | Missing DNS egress policy (UDP 53 to `openshift-dns`) |
| Works in Silver, fails in Emerald | Missing AVI InfraSettings annotation or DataClass pod label |
| Inter-namespace flow fails | Receiver ingress policy lacks `namespaceSelector` for sender |
| External partner connectivity fails | 3PG not configured; direct egress blocked at zone boundary |

---

## NetworkPolicy Checklist

Before declaring a flow complete:
- [ ] Egress policy exists on the **sender** pod
- [ ] Ingress policy exists on the **receiver** pod
- [ ] DNS egress policy present on every pod that resolves hostnames
- [ ] `DataClass` pod label set and matches AVI annotation
- [ ] `owner` and `environment` pod labels present (Emerald requirement)
- [ ] AVI InfraSettings annotation: `dataclass-medium` / `dataclass-high` / `dataclass-public`
