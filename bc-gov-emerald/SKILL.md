# BC Gov Emerald Platform Standards

Emerald-specific mechanics only. Platform-independent concepts live in companion skills:

- Zone model, ISCF classification, internet egress constraints → `bc-gov-sdn-zones`
- NetworkPolicy YAML patterns and two-policy rule → `bc-gov-networkpolicy`
- End-to-end network architecture reasoning → `bc-gov-network-architect` agent

---

## Namespace Convention

```
<license>-dev     ← development
<license>-test    ← staging / QA
<license>-prod    ← production
<license>-tools   ← CI/CD tooling, Artifactory, Vault
```

## AVI InfraSettings — Route Annotation

Controls which VIP pool handles the Route. **Get this wrong and traffic silently drops.**

| Annotation value | VIP | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dataclass-medium` | Private VIP — VPN only | ✅ All internal workloads (default) |
| `dataclass-high` | Private VIP — sensitive data | Higher-trust internal workloads |
| `dataclass-public` | Public internet VIP | Internet-facing routes with public exposure |
| `dataclass-low` | ⚠️ NO VIP on Emerald | **NEVER USE** — DNS resolves but `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE` |

```yaml
# Required on every OpenShift Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    aviinfrasetting.ako.vmware.com/name: "dataclass-medium"
```

AKO re-adds this annotation within ~15 seconds if removed — always keep it in Helm values.

---

## DataClass Pod Label

Pod `DataClass` label **must match** the AVI annotation suffix.

```yaml
podLabels:
  DataClass: "Medium"   # matches "dataclass-medium" annotation
```

Mismatch rule: `DataClass: Low` + `dataclass-medium` route → SDN silently drops traffic.

### Required pod labels (enforced by ag-devops Datree + Conftest)

Every Deployment/StatefulSet pod template must carry **all three** labels. Missing any will cause the ag-devops policy gate to deny the manifest.

```yaml
podLabels:
  DataClass: "Medium"          # Low | Medium | High
  owner: "<team-or-ticket>"    # team name or Jira ticket reference
  environment: "development"   # production | test | development (exact values)
```

When using `ag-template.deployment`, set `ModuleValues.dataClass` (renders `DataClass`) and add `owner`/`environment` via a `LabelData` fragment:

```yaml
{{- define "myapp.labels" -}}
owner: jag-pssg-team
environment: development
{{- end }}
# ... in dict: set $p "LabelData" "myapp.labels"
```

### Internet-Ingress label

```yaml
podLabels:
  Internet-Ingress: "DENY"    # default — correct for all internal services
  # Internet-Ingress: "ALLOW" # only if reachable from public internet via Public VIP
```

For the full ISCF → DataClass mapping and zone egress constraints, see `bc-gov-sdn-zones`.

---

## NetworkPolicy Model

Emerald default-denies **both Ingress AND Egress**. See `bc-gov-networkpolicy` for full YAML
patterns, the two-policy rule, DNS egress, CIDR egress, and the debugging checklist.

Quick reminder of the flows that need policies on Emerald:

| Flow | Policy needed |
| --- | --- |
| Router → Frontend | Ingress on Frontend |
| Router → API | Ingress on API |
| Frontend → API | Ingress on API **+** Egress from Frontend |
| API → DB | Ingress on DB **+** Egress from API |
| Any pod → DNS | Egress UDP+TCP 53 on every pod |

---

## Route Edge Termination (Conftest hard-deny)

ag-devops Conftest denies **edge-terminated** Routes unless the Route has either:

- Label `app.kubernetes.io/component: frontend`, **or**
- Annotation `isb.gov.bc.ca/edge-termination-approval: "<ticket>"`

Passthrough (`spec.tls.termination: passthrough`) and re-encrypt termination are not affected.

```yaml
# If edge termination is approved:
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: frontend   # OR:
  annotations:
    isb.gov.bc.ca/edge-termination-approval: "ISB-12345"
```

---

## PriorityClass (Polaris `priorityClassNotSet` check)

Every Deployment and StatefulSet must reference a `PriorityClass`. Polaris issues a failure if `spec.template.spec.priorityClassName` is unset. Define one PriorityClass per application group in the chart:

```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
kind: PriorityClass
metadata:
  name: <app>-priority
value: 1000000
globalDefault: false
```

Then in each workload:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      priorityClassName: <app>-priority
```

---

## OpenShift Mode in Helm (`global.openshift: true`)

Set this in every Helm chart's `values.yaml` targeting Emerald:

```yaml
global:
  openshift: true
```

Effect:

- Deployment/Job pod `securityContext` does **not** pin `runAsUser`/`runAsGroup` — OpenShift SCC assigns runtime UID/GID
- Adds `checkov.io/skip999: CKV_K8S_40=...` annotation to suppress Checkov false-positive
- Still enforces `runAsNonRoot`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`, capabilities drop ALL

> ⚠️ Omitting `global.openshift: true` when using the ag-helm library chart causes the
> deployment template to pin `runAsUser: 10001` which may conflict with the namespace's SCC.

---

## StorageClass

Choose based on access mode and workload type:

| StorageClass | Access mode | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `netapp-file-standard` | RWX (multi-pod) | Shared file storage, build artefacts, config mounts |
| `netapp-block-standard` | RWO (single-pod) | Databases, stateful workloads requiring higher IOPS |

```yaml
# For shared / file-based workloads:
storageClassName: netapp-file-standard

# For databases and stateful workloads (preferred for block I/O performance):
storageClassName: netapp-block-standard
```

> `netapp-block-standard` is single-pod (RWO) — do not use for workloads that require
> concurrent access from multiple pods.

---

## DNS Split-Tunneling

Route hostnames (`*.apps.emerald.devops.gov.bc.ca`) resolve only via BC Gov VPN DNS.
Local / home DNS returns NXDOMAIN. Ensure VPN client routes this domain through VPN DNS
before debugging route connectivity issues.
